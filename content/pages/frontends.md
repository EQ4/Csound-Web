Csound comes without any interface. If you do not want to use Csound via the Terminal or the API, you will need a "frontend". Currently, three frontends are available:

**CsoundQt** ([http://sourceforge.net/projects/qutecsound/](http://sourceforge.net/projects/qutecsound/)) is most probably already included in the Mac and Windows installer. It has nice tools for editing Csound files, comes with easy editable widgets and a huge example collection.

**Cabbage** ([http://www.thecabbagefoundation.org](http://www.thecabbagefoundation.org) and [http://code.google.com/p/cabbage/](http://code.google.com/p/cabbage/)) is originally designed to create VST plugins from Csound instruments, but it can also be used to run and edit Csound files, as well as creating standalone applications.

**Blue** ([http://sourceforge.net/projects/bluemusic/](http://sourceforge.net/projects/bluemusic/)) is a huge composition tool for working with Csound.
